## Why learn python ?

### What can Python do for you ?
Imagine a world where you can make your computer do things for you, like automate repetitive tasks or analyze information.

Python is a special language that helps you make this happen.


Python is a programming language, but think of it more like a tool that lets you communicate with your computer. It's known for being friendly and easy to understand, it is made of simple English words such as **if** (=li), **then** (=pak),  **for** (=opakovat).


You can use Python to automate tasks, like renaming organizing your photos, perform calculations. It's like having a helpful assistant.

With Python, you write commands or instructions in a way that the computer understands. It then follows these instructions and responds accordingly. It's a bit like giving your computer a to-do list. It can take decisions and repeat tasks.


### Who is using Python ?

Python is used in various fields. For example, in finance, it helps analyze trends in stock markets. 

It is useful in science, where scientists around the world employ it to share their research. 

It is useful to make web sites and edit books (both on paper and in electronic format).

It is even used in art, as some artists and creators use it to generate music, make video games or even generate paintings, photos and video sequences.

One of the best things about Python is the community. There are many people around the world who use and love Python. You can find help, share ideas, and learn from others who enjoy exploring this language.

### The power is yours

In a nutshell, Python empowers you to do cool things with your computer, whether you're organizing files, creating art, or diving into new adventures. It's a tool that unlocks your creativity and makes technology work for you.


<!-- ## Data in Python

### Lists

A list in Python is like a container where you can put multiple items in a specific order. It's a bit like making a checklist or jotting down things you need to do.

For example, a list of your favorite fruits could look like this: 

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

You can easily add, remove, or rearrange items in the list.


### Dictionaries

Think of a dictionary as a special book where each item has a label or a key. It's like having a mini guide that helps you find things quickly.

For instance, a contact list in Python might be a dictionary: 

contact = 
{ 'name': 'John'
 ,'email': 'john@email.com'
 , 'phone': '123-456-7890'}

You use keys like 'name' or 'email' to access specific information. -->

## Pandas

Pandas is a Python library that helps you work with structured data effortlessly. It's like having a powerful tool to manipulate and analyze data tables, making tasks like data cleaning and analysis much easier.

If you use Microsoft Excel, imagine being to tell it to clean and update information, do complex calculations with a single instruction (instead of having to cut and paste formulas everywhere).
